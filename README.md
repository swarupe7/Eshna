# Eshna - Empowering Menstrual Health

![Eshna Logo](/logo.png)

## Introduction

Eshna is a transformative initiative dedicated to empowering women and girls during their menstrual cycles. Our mission is to provide education, support, and resources to promote menstrual health and hygiene while breaking taboos and fostering a community of empowerment.

## Inspiration

Eshna was inspired by the need to address challenges such as:

- Lack of awareness and education about menstrual health.
- Cultural taboos and stigmas surrounding menstruation.
- The need for a confidential support system for women and girls.
- Bridging the gap in access to information and resources.

## What Eshna Does

Eshna offers a range of services and resources, including:

- **Education and Awareness**: Informative articles, guides, and materials to foster awareness and dispel myths.
- **Stigma Reduction**: Challenging menstrual taboos through open discussions and awareness campaigns.
- **Confidential Support**: A contact form connected through EmailJS for users to seek guidance while maintaining privacy.
- **Health Reminders**: Automated reminders sent to users' email addresses based on their menstrual cycle dates.
- **Community Building**: Eshna's vision to become an open-source project, inviting contributions from the community.
