    <h1>Menustral Symptoms For Women</h1>
    <p>Women can experience a wide range of symptoms during, before, and after their menstrual cycle, which is a normal part of the reproductive system. These symptoms can vary greatly from person to person and from cycle to cycle. It's important to note that while some discomfort or mild symptoms are common, severe or unusual symptoms should be discussed with a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Here's an overview of common symptoms:</p>

    <!--pre -->
    <div class="cycle">
        <h2>Before Menstruation (Premenstrual Phase):</h2>
        <h4>Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS): </h4>
        <p>PMS encompasses a range of physical and emotional symptoms that occur in the days or weeks leading up to menstruation. Common symptoms include mood swings, irritability, bloating, breast tenderness, food cravings, and fatigue.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- during -->
    <div class="cycle">
        <h2>During Menstruation (Menstrual Phase):</h2>
        <h4>Menstrual Cramps:</h4>
        <p>Many women experience cramping in the lower abdomen as the uterus contracts to shed its lining. These cramps can range from mild to severe.</p>
        <h4>Heavy Bleeding:</h4> 
        <p>Some women may have heavier menstrual flow than others, which can lead to a need for frequent changing of menstrual products.</p>  
        <h4>Blood Clots:</h4>
        <p>Passing small blood clots during menstruation can be normal, but larger clots may be a cause for concern.</p>   
        <h4>Back Pain:</h4> 
        <p>Lower back pain is a common symptom during menstruation.</p>
        <h4>Headaches:</h4>    
        <p>Some women experience headaches or migraines during their period.</p>     
        <h4>Fatigue:</h4> 
        <p>Blood loss and hormonal fluctuations can lead to feelings of fatigue.</p>   
        <h4>Mood Changes:</h4>
        <p>Hormonal changes can affect mood, leading to feelings of sadness or irritability.</p>    
        <h4>Gastrointestinal Issues:</h4> 
        <p>Some women may experience diarrhea or constipation during their period.</p>    
        <h4>Breast Discomfort:</h4>
        <p>Breast tenderness and swelling can continue into the menstrual phase for some women.</p>    
    </div>

    <div class="cycle">
        <h2>After Menstruation (Postmenstrual Phase):</h2>
        <h4>Ovulation:</h4>
        <p>After menstruation, women typically experience a period of fertility and may notice changes in cervical mucus and pelvic discomfort, known as mittelschmerz.</p>
        <h4>Menstrual Migraines:</h4>
        <p>Some women experience migraines at the end of their period or during ovulation.</p>
        <h4>Hormonal Changes:</h4>
        <p>Hormone levels fluctuate during the menstrual cycle, and some women may notice changes in their skin, hair, or energy levels.</p>
        <h4>Relief from Symptoms:</h4>    
        <p>Many of the symptoms experienced before and during menstruation gradually subside in the days following the menstrual cycle.</p>
        <p>It's essential to remember that these symptoms can vary greatly from person to person and cycle to cycle. Additionally, some women may experience medical conditions like endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or fibroids, which can cause more severe or atypical symptoms. If you have concerns about your menstrual symptoms, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and guidance on managing any discomfort or health issues.</p>
